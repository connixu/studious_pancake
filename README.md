This is a GitHub Repository for developed projects completed as part of academic coursework and larger projects. 

## Projects: 
- [Are Feminists More Unhappy?](https://github.com/connixu/studious_pancake/tree/main/Feminist_Happiness): an exploration using various regression techniques on the World Values Survey (Wave 6) to explore whether women were more or less unhappy (controlling for factors such as the Gini Index, Marital Status, etc.)  
  - Initially loaded as panel data to allow for later work in looking at cross-wave pooled analysis.
