This is a GitHub Repository for developed projects completed as part of academic coursework and larger projects. 

## Projects: 
- [Are Feminists More Unhappy?](https://github.com/connixu/studious_pancake/tree/main/Feminist_Happiness):  
  This was an exploration using various regression techniques on the World Values Survey (Wave 6) to explore whether women were more or less unhappy (controlling for factors such as the Gini Index, Marital Status, etc.)  
  - Initially loaded as panel data to allow for later work in looking at cross-wave pooled analysis. 

- [Sampson Monk Networks](https://github.com/connixu/studious_pancake/blob/main/Sampson_Monk_Networks/Sampson_Monk_Networks.md):  
  This project is based on network cloisters data as collected by Vermont sociologist Samuel F. Sampson[1], when Sampson was studying and observing the social interactions of a group of monks; during this research, there was a crisis in the cloister leading to the expulsion and voluntary exit of a number of monks. This work includes network visualizations and analyses of centrality and group membership measures, and was completed as a demonstration of basic social network analysis abilities.
