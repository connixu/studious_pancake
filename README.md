This is a GitHub Repository for developed projects completed as part of academic coursework and larger projects. 

## Projects: 
- [Are Feminists More Unhappy?](https://github.com/connixu/studious_pancake/blob/main/QMSS%205015-Independent%20Project.pdf): an exploration using various regression techniques on the World Values Survey to explore whether women were more or less unhappy (controlling for factors such as the Gini Index, etc.)

- Student Debt Visualization Website (April 2021)
See shiny.io website [here](https://ukipv4-connie-xu.shinyapps.io/Group_G_HigherEd_Review/)
This website visualizes trends around student loans, repayment, and opinions as they relate to geogrpahic and socioeconomic stratification; it was created in fulfillment of a Data Visualization course from Spring 2021 term. As this was a team project, my contributions included: 
  - R Shiny Visual Map showing student debt levels over time ([code here]())
  - Edited introductory page 
  - Scatterplot showing student debt vs school selectivity 
  - Line plot showing student debt for different 'clusters' of selective schools over time
